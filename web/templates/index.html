		<h3>Tech-savvy developer...</h3>
		<p>
			Part of what I study at Wilfrid Laurier University is computer science.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am seriously in love with technology. I think there's amazing things to be done with it,
			and I'm really interested in discovering those things. I'm not afraid to learn what I don't
			know, and I embrace new ways of solving problems.

		<h3>...with a mind for business</h3>
		<p>
			The other part I study is business administration.
		</p>
		<p>
			A business education gives me the mindset to consider the bigger picture when its necessary.
			More importantly, business is about turning an idea into an action. Its this philosophy which
			propels my thinking. I've got the business know-how to supplement my developing background.
